# Goals
- Convince the city-states of the HUC to
rally under one banner, come to the aid
of Evergreen, and continue the war
against the Machine.

# Stakes
- If the HUC is not convinced to aid
Evergreen, the Hercynians won’t come to
Evergreen’s aid in MISSION 5 without
some extra effort.

# Reserves
- None.
