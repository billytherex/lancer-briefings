# Mission // #004
## Rallying Cry

In a few days, the leaders of the HUC are going to
have a meeting to decide how to proceed with the
war against the Machine. The PCs will be present for
this meeting as representatives of Evergreen.
In the meantime, they have opportunities to make
inroads with the various factions of Hivehome’s
leadership. Since there is limited time, they will only be able to aid one
group.

# Goals
- Convince the city-states of the HUC to
rally under one banner, come to the aid
of Evergreen, and continue the war
against the Machine.

# Stakes
- If the HUC is not convinced to aid
Evergreen, the Hercynians won’t come to
Evergreen’s aid in MISSION 5 without
some extra effort.

# Reserves
- None.
