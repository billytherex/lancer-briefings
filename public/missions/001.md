# Mission // #001
## Bug-Hunt

Before the settlement’s landing bowl can be drained and
given essential updates, Chief Engineer Fielding needs to
complete critical repairs. This will make offworld landings
easier and allow larger ships to land at Evergreen without the
use of shuttles. To complete this mission, the characters will
have to escort Fielding and some of his workers and protect
them while they complete repairs.

# Goals
- Stabilize the situation around Evergreen. Track
the raiders, try to discover who they are, and
stop the attacks.

# Stakes
- If the Lancers are unable to complete either of the
first two combats or fail to rescue
the Châus, Evergreen will be
forced to pull back and will lose contact with
the farms.

# Reserves
- None.
