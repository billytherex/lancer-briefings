# Mission // #005
## Split-Knuckle Haymaker

There are two ways the Lancers can approach this
mission. At any time, they can choose to simply attack
the Governorâ€™s Farm directly. Going right here
without preparation or dealing with the Cassander will
be extremely difficult.

The other is to prepare by getting the HUC to aid
Evergreen, freeing
Contingency White from prison, and disabling the
Cassander.

All that remains is eliminating Beggar One.

# Goals
- Defeat Beggar One.

# Stakes
- If this mission fails, Evergreen will remain
  occupied and the extermination of the
  local population will begin.

# Reserves
- Cassander Orbital Bombardment
- Multiple Full Repairs Available
