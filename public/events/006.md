# >//SETTLING IN // 3.13.5016u
The team spent nearly a year apart after their debriefing on Cradle. However, they were each recalled by Union to be dispatched on a mission to the world of Cerlas. With the exception of Louis, Squadron 413 was reformed and deployed to Base Alpha to meet with their contact, Aria Vance. After landing, the Lancers met a new member, the enigmatic Interpreter. He relayed the information he knew: The surveyor team had gone missing several days prior during a communications blackout and were approximately 10 miles to the north of Brightpoint, deep in the desert of Cerlas. They departed after collecting their freshly printed mechs.

The team encountered a strange radio signal, which Scipio quickly descrambled. As it turned out, a large nearby electromagnetic storm was disrupting communications from the outpost Sandrift. The Cerlasin outpost was under attack by massive creatures and were quickly rescued by the team. The Lancers then entered the outpost to meet Jarek, Old Nalia, and Renna.
