After the debriefing on Cradle, our team underwent a prolonged separation, spanning nearly a year. However, Union has now summoned each member back into action, reuniting us for a critical mission to the enigmatic world of Cerlas. Our valiant Squadron 413 has been reassembled, with the exception of Louis, and we have been swiftly deployed to Base Alpha, where we are to rendezvous with our contact, Aria Vance.

Upon our arrival and subsequent landing, we were greeted by an unexpected addition to our ranks, the enigmatic Interpreter. His presence brought an air of mystery, but he wasted no time in relaying crucial information to our team. We learned that a surveyor team had vanished without a trace during a distressing period of communication blackout. According to the Interpreter, they were believed to be located approximately 10 miles north of Brightpoint, deeply entrenched in Cerlas' unforgiving desert.

Before setting out on our mission, we took the opportunity to equip ourselves with the latest technology, collecting our freshly printed mechs. It was a reassuring sight, knowing we would have the means to face whatever challenges awaited us on this treacherous world.

As we ventured forth, our team soon encountered a peculiar radio signal, crackling with distortion. Swiftly, Scipio utilized his expertise to decipher the message hidden within the chaos. To our surprise, we discovered that a colossal electromagnetic storm loomed nearby, disrupting all communication from the beleaguered outpost Sandrift. Even more dire was the news that the outpost was under siege by gargantuan creatures, threatening the lives of its inhabitants.

Without hesitation, we rushed to the aid of our fellow Union forces, launching a daring rescue operation. With skill and determination, we managed to extract them from the clutches of peril, ensuring their safety.

Having successfully accomplished our objective, we proceeded into the heart of the outpost, where we were welcomed by Jarek, Old Nalia, and Renna. Their presence offered a glimmer of hope in this hostile environment, and we knew that together, we stood a chance of uncovering the secrets that Cerlas held within its ancient sands.

End transmission.

# >//INSIGHT Log // 3.13.5016u-B
From the grand wisdom imparted by Jarek and the noble denizens of Sandrift, our gallant cadre of Lancers embarked on a northern quest to seek out the two intrepid Union surveyor teams. The maiden camp was located, and through diligent investigation, our brave comrades discerned that the surveyors of the famed Outpost Sigma had fallen victim to an unknown adversary's assault.

Treading the bloody path emanating from the desolate Outpost, our team happened upon a maimed device situated just beyond a diminutive cave entrance. Within, the Lancers uncovered an enigmatic cavern adorned with walls that pulsated with a gentle cyan hue at the merest touch. Pressing further into the abyss, they united to conquer a formidable chasm. Our Interpreter, blessed with ingenuity, drafted a bridge whilst our valiant Scipio proved his worth in its assembly, with Danger and Jiren lending their steadfast strength to shepherd the team across the daunting divide.

They stumbled upon a grander chamber, a faint luminescence dancing at the cavernous end. Yet, calamity struck as they were waylaid by a fearsome Chasm Crawler. This monstrous beast coiled to pounce upon them. Interpreter and Danger, ever the courageous duo, contended with the creature, sending it scurrying away whilst Scipio and Jiren masterfully executed a strategic retreat. Ultimately, our brave Lancers unearthed a datapad. It showed that Outpost Sigma had discovered a gem christened Cerlasite, a crystal with enigmatic properties presumed to be of considerable potency. Its keeper wore an uniform of glistening gold and ebony hues. Deeming their investigations complete, the team charted a brief eastern course towards Outpost Tau.

Upon arrival, a mirror image of desolation greeted them; a forsaken encampment riddled with signs of conflict. Here, they discovered a fallen comrade, adorned in purple and grey regalia. In proximity, the team attempted to breach a data terminal, striving to extract video footage and communication transcripts. Alas, as the data decryption commenced, our brave Lancers found themselves besieged by a menacing band of raiders, who emerged from the intensifying maelstrom of a sandstorm swirling around them.

The onslaught was valiantly repelled, yet their efforts were thwarted as the data was hijacked by an unidentified presence. Gazing upwards, our gallant Lancers beheld a solitary Mech plummeting from the precipice of a levitating shard of ruined land. The mechanised monstrosity touched ground, weapons gleaming and systems humming ominously, ready for the coming storm.

Insight out, prepared to face the trials that lie ahead.

# >//INSIGHT Log // 3.13.5016u-C
The encounter bore the dreadful scent of impending doom, yet our resolute Lancers rallied and, against overwhelming odds, toppled the mighty adversary. The enemy, an exotic marvel, brandished an enigma of unknown and alien systems upon its mech. Despite the ferocious onslaught that saw the enemy's mechanised juggernaut consumed by a relentless barrage of our potent energy and kinetic ordnance, it nonetheless wreaked havoc upon Scipio's mighty Apollo before ultimately succumbing. Post this fierce engagement, our stalwart team opted to journey back to Sandrift to seek any knowledge from the populace regarding a mech suit of similar design.

Whilst Jarek proved to be bereft of any clues, aged Nalia offered a glimmer of hope, a recollection of relevance. She harkened back to the olden days of the settlement of Dusk, a mere ten miles west of Sandrift, that was decimated under an abrupt bombardment of debris originating from the fragmented landscape aloft. She, alongside a scant few, miraculously escaped the calamity and vividly recalled the ominous presence of a horde of mechanised chassis, akin to those encountered by our Lancers, looming over the devastated village. None amongst the village of Sandrift, however, recognised the mysterious cyan-hued material discovered within the caves of Outpost Sigma.

Armed with this newfound wisdom from venerable Nalia, our Lancers returned to the sanctity of Base Alpha, briefing Captain Aria Vance. While she could shed little light on the provenance of the exotic mech, she urged the team to continue their search for the missing squads. Shortly thereafter, two separate missives arrived, invitations from Director Grant of Bright Rampart and Emilia Reyes of the Heritor Consortium. Opting for Director Grant's summons, our team prepared for a punctual 9 a.m. meeting at the towering opulence of Bright Rampart.

Director Grant, a man of steely gaze and sinister intent, harboured dreams of tranquillity procured through might and order forged by force. His desire for power and control was as evident as the morning sun. Despite his seductive promises of abundant resources and Manna, the currency of these diasporan worlds, our team held no interest in aligning with him. They bid farewell to the tower and set off to engage with Emilia Reyes.

Their journey was via hovercraft, landing just within the confines of Heritance city. They then proceeded on foot into the sprawling marketplace of Heritance. There they were intercepted by Layla, a young and enthusiastic Cerlasin woman who appeared to harbour great admiration for the Lancers, inviting them to a meeting with Rahim, the formidable leader of the Cerlasin Resistance. After clarifying that their initial meeting would be with Ms. Reyes, Layla agreed to rendezvous post their meeting and promptly vanished into the bustling crowd.

Emilia Reyes echoed Director Grant's ambition for control over the region, yet she exuded a unique empathetic concern for the plight of the Cerlasins. Ms. Reyes expressed her intent to strike a balance between resource extraction and the preservation of freedom for the people, thereby fostering a thriving capitalism that also ensured cultural and environmental concerns were accounted for. However, the feasibility of such a delicate balance remained an enigma to our Lancers.

Deciding to withhold their response to Ms. Reyes for the moment, our team chose to heed Layla's invitation to meet with Rahim. They journeyed to Akbarr's Oasis, a nearby traders' enclave deemed a neutral meeting ground. Within the confines of a local cantina, 'The Serpent', they engaged with Rahim. He was a stern yet flamboyant man, who managed to exude a blend of aggression and civility in the same breath. The Lancers noted a distinctive Union insignia adorning his shoulder pauldron, a badge he confirmed as a testament to his service to the Union. Rahim claimed a significant tenure with the Union before he chose to return to Cerlas to defend his homeland.

Post a round of persuasive assurances from Rahim, promising valuable insights regarding the alien mech they had encountered, the team decided to align with Rahim. Yet, whether this enigmatic ally can deliver on his bold promises remains shrouded in uncertainty. This alliance, they agreed, was an act of necessity, and the repercussions of such a choice will only be revealed by the unfurling fabric of time.
