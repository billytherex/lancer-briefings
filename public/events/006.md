# >//INSIGHT Log // 3.13.5016u
After the debriefing on Cradle, our team underwent a prolonged separation, spanning nearly a year. However, Union has now summoned each member back into action, reuniting us for a critical mission to the enigmatic world of Cerlas. Our valiant Squadron 413 has been reassembled, with the exception of Louis, and we have been swiftly deployed to Base Alpha, where we are to rendezvous with our contact, Aria Vance.

Upon our arrival and subsequent landing, we were greeted by an unexpected addition to our ranks, the enigmatic Interpreter. His presence brought an air of mystery, but he wasted no time in relaying crucial information to our team. We learned that a surveyor team had vanished without a trace during a distressing period of communication blackout. According to the Interpreter, they were believed to be located approximately 10 miles north of Brightpoint, deeply entrenched in Cerlas' unforgiving desert.

Before setting out on our mission, we took the opportunity to equip ourselves with the latest technology, collecting our freshly printed mechs. It was a reassuring sight, knowing we would have the means to face whatever challenges awaited us on this treacherous world.

As we ventured forth, our team soon encountered a peculiar radio signal, crackling with distortion. Swiftly, Scipio utilized his expertise to decipher the message hidden within the chaos. To our surprise, we discovered that a colossal electromagnetic storm loomed nearby, disrupting all communication from the beleaguered outpost Sandrift. Even more dire was the news that the outpost was under siege by gargantuan creatures, threatening the lives of its inhabitants.

Without hesitation, we rushed to the aid of our fellow Union forces, launching a daring rescue operation. With skill and determination, we managed to extract them from the clutches of peril, ensuring their safety.

Having successfully accomplished our objective, we proceeded into the heart of the outpost, where we were welcomed by Jarek, Old Nalia, and Renna. Their presence offered a glimmer of hope in this hostile environment, and we knew that together, we stood a chance of uncovering the secrets that Cerlas held within its ancient sands.

End transmission.

Guided by the sage advice of Jarek and the Sandrift citizenry, the Lancers set course northwards, intent on locating the two missing Union surveyor teams. We discovered the initial encampment, known as Outpost Sigma, desolate and forsaken. A thorough sweep of the area revealed signs of a violent skirmish, though the attacker's identity remains elusive. A gory path led us to a marred device at the mouth of a quaint cavern.

Within this subterranean complex, the walls radiated a muted cyan aura upon contact. Our path led us across a daunting chasm which we surmounted through ingenious collaboration. The Interpreter envisioned a bridge, whilst Scipio brought this idea to life with his craftsmanship. Danger and Jiren provided the necessary support to ensure a safe passage for all.

Further exploration led us to a spacious chamber, a faint luminosity detectable at its far end. It was here that we were blindsided by a Chasm Crawler. The beast lunged at us, but the combined might of Interpreter and Danger held it at bay, allowing Scipio and Jiren to execute a strategic retreat.

Our findings included a datapad containing information regarding Outpost Sigma's discovery - a crystal now referred to as Cerlasite. Its potential remains unknown. The body bearing the datapad was adorned in hues of gold and black. We took our leave, shifting our trajectory slightly east towards Outpost Tau.

There, we stumbled upon a scene mirroring Outpost Sigma, echoing with tales of battle and abandonment. Among the ruins, a fallen soldier donned in purple and gray was found. An attempt to extract data from a nearby terminal led us straight into a raider ambush, their arrival concealed by an encroaching sandstorm.

Despite our successful repulsion of the raiders, the data was surreptitiously intercepted by an unidentified agent. As we scanned the sky, a solitary Mech emerged from the fringe of a floating fragment of terrain. The behemoth touched down, its weapons and systems at the ready, presenting a new and ominous challenge.
