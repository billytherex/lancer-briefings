# >//INSIGHT Log // 3.13.5016u
After the debriefing on Cradle, our team underwent a prolonged separation, spanning nearly a year. However, Union has now summoned each member back into action, reuniting us for a critical mission to the enigmatic world of Cerlas. Our valiant Squadron 413 has been reassembled, with the exception of Louis, and we have been swiftly deployed to Base Alpha, where we are to rendezvous with our contact, Aria Vance.

Upon our arrival and subsequent landing, we were greeted by an unexpected addition to our ranks, the enigmatic Interpreter. His presence brought an air of mystery, but he wasted no time in relaying crucial information to our team. We learned that a surveyor team had vanished without a trace during a distressing period of communication blackout. According to the Interpreter, they were believed to be located approximately 10 miles north of Brightpoint, deeply entrenched in Cerlas' unforgiving desert.

Before setting out on our mission, we took the opportunity to equip ourselves with the latest technology, collecting our freshly printed mechs. It was a reassuring sight, knowing we would have the means to face whatever challenges awaited us on this treacherous world.

As we ventured forth, our team soon encountered a peculiar radio signal, crackling with distortion. Swiftly, Scipio utilized his expertise to decipher the message hidden within the chaos. To our surprise, we discovered that a colossal electromagnetic storm loomed nearby, disrupting all communication from the beleaguered outpost Sandrift. Even more dire was the news that the outpost was under siege by gargantuan creatures, threatening the lives of its inhabitants.

Without hesitation, we rushed to the aid of our fellow Union forces, launching a daring rescue operation. With skill and determination, we managed to extract them from the clutches of peril, ensuring their safety.

Having successfully accomplished our objective, we proceeded into the heart of the outpost, where we were welcomed by Jarek, Old Nalia, and Renna. Their presence offered a glimmer of hope in this hostile environment, and we knew that together, we stood a chance of uncovering the secrets that Cerlas held within its ancient sands.

End transmission.

# >//INSIGHT Log // 3.13.5016u-B
From the grand wisdom imparted by Jarek and the noble denizens of Sandrift, our gallant cadre of Lancers embarked on a northern quest to seek out the two intrepid Union surveyor teams. The maiden camp was located, and through diligent investigation, our brave comrades discerned that the surveyors of the famed Outpost Sigma had fallen victim to an unknown adversary's assault.

Treading the bloody path emanating from the desolate Outpost, our team happened upon a maimed device situated just beyond a diminutive cave entrance. Within, the Lancers uncovered an enigmatic cavern adorned with walls that pulsated with a gentle cyan hue at the merest touch. Pressing further into the abyss, they united to conquer a formidable chasm. Our Interpreter, blessed with ingenuity, drafted a bridge whilst our valiant Scipio proved his worth in its assembly, with Danger and Jiren lending their steadfast strength to shepherd the team across the daunting divide.

They stumbled upon a grander chamber, a faint luminescence dancing at the cavernous end. Yet, calamity struck as they were waylaid by a fearsome Chasm Crawler. This monstrous beast coiled to pounce upon them. Interpreter and Danger, ever the courageous duo, contended with the creature, sending it scurrying away whilst Scipio and Jiren masterfully executed a strategic retreat. Ultimately, our brave Lancers unearthed a datapad. It showed that Outpost Sigma had discovered a gem christened Cerlasite, a crystal with enigmatic properties presumed to be of considerable potency. Its keeper wore an uniform of glistening gold and ebony hues. Deeming their investigations complete, the team charted a brief eastern course towards Outpost Tau.

Upon arrival, a mirror image of desolation greeted them; a forsaken encampment riddled with signs of conflict. Here, they discovered a fallen comrade, adorned in purple and grey regalia. In proximity, the team attempted to breach a data terminal, striving to extract video footage and communication transcripts. Alas, as the data decryption commenced, our brave Lancers found themselves besieged by a menacing band of raiders, who emerged from the intensifying maelstrom of a sandstorm swirling around them.

The onslaught was valiantly repelled, yet their efforts were thwarted as the data was hijacked by an unidentified presence. Gazing upwards, our gallant Lancers beheld a solitary Mech plummeting from the precipice of a levitating shard of ruined land. The mechanised monstrosity touched ground, weapons gleaming and systems humming ominously, ready for the coming storm.

Insight out, prepared to face the trials that lie ahead.
