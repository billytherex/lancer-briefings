Mission Coordinator: **Layla** and **Rahim**

Location: Cerlas - various locations

Overview:
Having arrived on Cerlas, you've begun to get a sense of the complex dynamics at play. **Bright Rampart** and the **Heritor Consortium** have both extended offers of support, each with their own potential benefits and drawbacks. Despite the considerable resources they promise, you've decided to postpone a decision regarding these factions.

Instead, you've chosen to accept the offer extended by Rahim through Layla, a representative of the local Cerlasin population. Though lacking the corporate resources, the Cerlasins possess invaluable knowledge of the land and its hidden dangers. It's clear they need your help to stand against the larger factions.

Objectives:
- Provide assistance to the **Cerlasins** as requested - this could range from defending against wildlife attacks, to helping fortify their settlements, to supporting them in disputes against the mining corporations.
- Investigate Cerlasin reports of increasing mining accidents and their suspicion of **Bright Rampart** and **Heritor Consortium**'s involvement. Gather evidence of any corporate wrongdoings. Continue to search for any information related to the missing surveyor teams.
- Threat Assessment:
Expect to encounter actors native to Cerlas. Additionally, be prepared for possible confrontations with corporate security forces if your investigations tread on sensitive areas. Magnetic storms, though less frequent in inhabited areas due to damping technology, remain a potential environmental hazard.

Support:
As an ally of the Cerlasins, you can rely on their support in navigating the local terrain and in dealing with local threats. They may lack advanced technology, but their knowledge of Cerlas is unparalleled.

Remember: The decisions you make will not only affect your mission but also the lives of the Cerlasins caught in this corporate tug of war. Choose your actions wisely.
# >//: INSIGHT LOG // 4.10.5016u
Having invested a week in contemplative solitude, punctuated by bouts of exhilarating tournament combat, our intrepid Lancers elected to cast their lot with the Cerlasin Resistance. Layla, their spirited liaison, materialised to chaperone the team to a clandestine meeting with Rahim. They were guided through a labyrinth of ancient caves, embedded deep within the skeletal remains of a civilisation long lost to time, the clandestine headquarters of the Cerlasin Resistance.

Rahim laid bare the grim reality of their struggle and beseeched the team to extinguish the looming spectre of a nearby industrial mining base. Their spirits steeled, our heroes consented with alacrity, setting off to tackle the formidable challenge that awaited. Yet, their initial attempts to stealthily infiltrate, and subsequent diplomatic endeavours, proved fruitless, compelling them to play their hand and clash with the local Bright Rampart mechanised forces.

In the ensuing skirmish, our gallant Lancers laid waste to multiple mechanised adversaries whilst simultaneously decimating the mining apparatus. By the climax of their audacious assault, no opposition stood to confront them. The battered and broken Bright Rampart forces hastily retreated, presumably seeking solace and regrouping within their clandestine military outpost nestled in the overlooking mountain ranges.
