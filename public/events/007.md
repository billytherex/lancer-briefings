Mission Coordinator: Layla and Rahim

Location: Cerlas - various locations

Overview:
Having arrived on Cerlas, you've begun to get a sense of the complex dynamics at play. Bright Rampart and the Heritor Consortium have both extended offers of support, each with their own potential benefits and drawbacks. Despite the considerable resources they promise, you've decided to postpone a decision regarding these factions.

Instead, you've chosen to accept the offer extended by Rahim through Layla, a representative of the local Cerlasin population. Though lacking the corporate resources, the Cerlasins possess invaluable knowledge of the land and its hidden dangers. It's clear they need your help to stand against the larger factions.

Objectives:
- Provide assistance to the Cerlasins as requested - this could range from defending against wildlife attacks, to helping fortify their settlements, to supporting them in disputes against the mining corporations.
- Investigate Cerlasin reports of increasing mining accidents and their suspicion of Bright Rampart and Heritor Consortium's involvement. Gather evidence of any corporate wrongdoings. Continue to search for any information related to the missing surveyor teams.
- Threat Assessment:
Expect to encounter actors native to Cerlas. Additionally, be prepared for possible confrontations with corporate security forces if your investigations tread on sensitive areas. Magnetic storms, though less frequent in inhabited areas due to damping technology, remain a potential environmental hazard.

Support:
As an ally of the Cerlasins, you can rely on their support in navigating the local terrain and in dealing with local threats. They may lack advanced technology, but their knowledge of Cerlas is unparalleled.

Remember: The decisions you make will not only affect your mission but also the lives of the Cerlasins caught in this corporate tug of war. Choose your actions wisely.
