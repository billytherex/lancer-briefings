The team followed a river of subalterns, crawling and clawing their way along a freshly forged path to the east. They discovered the subalterns had been digging a massive hole into the ground. Suddenly, their sensors detected an enormous swarm coming from below the surface. They were digging up to meet those digging down and finally burst through and began to pour out. The Lancers were forced to flee up the mountains to safety. The team's mechs were damaged harshly in the following combat, with Jiren's destroyed entirely. The team put a request into Evergreen, and with a massive effort by Chief Engineer Fielding and the resources of Evergreen, a mostly constructed replacement was airdropped in for Jiren. For the time being, the Lancers could do nothing but watch as the horde came forth.
