The Union Navy dispatched the Lancer team as a quick reaction team in response to reports of troubles in Evergreen. After arriving, the Lancers discovered that the city had been plagued by attacks from an indigenous population known as Hercyians, aided by a non-sapient arthropod species capable of using tools. The team met with Brava Hadura, Edena Ji, and Patience, where they were briefed on the local situation and presented with several opportunities to help.
 
The Lancers decided to help Chief Engineer Fielding with draining the nearby landing bowl of water. The landing bowl had filled after a pump failure- without it, Evergreen would be significantly impeded without logistical support. The team escorted Fielding and his team through an ambush with minimal casualties. While Fielding worked on the pump system, the group received an alert to the Gray Towns experiencing issues with their subalterns.
 
On the way, the Lancers saw numerous subalterns behaving abnormally. Once they arrived at Liu Maize, the source of the distress signal, they discovered that Albert Chau had become pinned inside his homestead along with his family. The Lancers fought through a horde of subalterns and mech-sized robots, including [The Broadcast], and managed to rescue the Chaus. They discovered a remote user titled ">//BEGGAR_ONE" had been issuing commands and executing imperatives from the farm's Comp/Con . Jiren also interfaced with the comp/con and became infected with a virus called Cynosure, which he promptly converted into a system for his mech.
